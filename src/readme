Description:
An input method based on Java(TM) Input Method Framework.
you can use it as Pinyin IME on java plantform.

Usages:
copy neoeime-ver.jar to jre/lib/ext,
then you can active it by choosing the "Select Input Method" menu 
from the menu that can be pulled down from the top left corner 
of the window (the System menu on Windows, Window menu on Solaris),
then choose "NeoeIME" and any locale from the popup menu.
Or you can press a hotkey, see http://javadesktop.org/articles/InputMethod/index.html

Feathers:
- Unicode. And Locale-indepentant.
- all GBK character in Pinyin
- over 40000 Chinese words.
- character and words is easy to extend by yourself, 
  they are written in UTF-8 plain text file in the jar.
- shift-key to temporary enable/disable IME.

the IME has tested on JEdit on Win32.

TODO
- auto change candidate order.


Have a try! It really nice on Linux now because luck of unicode ime support somehow.
